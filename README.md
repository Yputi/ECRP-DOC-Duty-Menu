# ECRP-DOC-Duty-Menu

The menu based version makes a menu pop-up where you can then select the action you want to perform. You can change the menu hotkey to anything you prefer by editing the file. The standard hotkey is set to F10.

## Important!
Edit your script file to add your own name, badge number, rank and callsigns!
Right click on the script file, open the file with a text editor (Notepad or Notepad++ for example) and adjust the lines with comments after it to your own stuff (They are in all caps, so quite easy to notice). Save it, close it and run it again once that's done (Single instance is on, so no need to close the previous one if you already ran it).
